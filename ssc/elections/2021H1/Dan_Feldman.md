A brief biography of the nominee goes here. What is their background? How does their work relate to SPIFFE and/or why is SPIFFE important to them? What about them makes them a good fit for the SSC? This information is very important and will be heavily considered by voters in order to make an informed decision.
Dan Feldman has a background as cloud security architect leading zero trust security projects at HP as well as spiffe.io . Dan has been actively involved in leading the SIG meetings. I believe his background and contributions make him a good fit.
